# p2e-plugin — Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor plugin for P2E

This plugin connects [P2E](https://github.com/columenlabs/p2e) story-map work to the P2E MCP server on Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor.

P2E is **product intelligence** — a living map of your product that grows iteratively as you capture UXOs, draft layers, implement, and land work. It is not a one-shot spec tool.

**v0.12+ ships a single skill: `p2e-mode`.** In Cursor, invoke `/p2e-mode` or run it as a Custom Mode for the session. Entity/assessment facts live in [`references/p2e-model.md`](skills/p2e-mode/references/p2e-model.md). Legacy `/p2e-*` slash commands are removed.

It tracks the P2E **Patton v3 Flow/Foundation model**: every project is a *Product* with two seeded Flows — a persona Flow (the user-journey lane) and an immutable Foundation Flow (8 platform/infra slots). Shipping work is packaged as unbounded **Waves** (`W{n}`, no W25 ceiling) owned by Product+Release; layers carry a denormalized wave stamp. See [Flow / Foundation model](#flow--foundation-model) below.

## How it works

| Surface | Path |
|---|---|
| Codex | `skills/p2e-mode/SKILL.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/p2e-mode/SKILL.md` |
| Claude Code | read the same skill content via plugin install |

**Story lifecycle:** `DRAFT → OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW → DONE` (+ `BLOCKED`). `IN_PROGRESS` = code + verify (evidence + VERIFIER); `IN_REVIEW` = blind second opinion and/or human **Mark DONE**. Details in [`p2e-mode`](skills/p2e-mode/SKILL.md).

Product repos may own their own copy of `p2e-mode` under `.cursor/skills/` — the plugin sync skips linking when a repo-owned copy exists.

## Install in Claude Code

From inside a Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin marketplace add columenlabs/p2e-plugin
/plugin install p2e@p2e-plugins
```

Pin the marketplace to a tag for stability:

```text
/plugin marketplace add columenlabs/p2e-plugin@v0.12.10
/plugin install p2e@p2e-plugins
```

The marketplace is named `p2e-plugins`; the plugin itself is named `p2e`.

## Install in Codex

This repository includes a native Codex plugin manifest at [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](./.codex-plugin/plugin.json) plus the shared MCP config at [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json).

Codex uses the **`p2e-mode`** skill as the sole entry point. Read it at session start before any P2E MCP operations.

## Install in Cursor

Cursor reads the `.cursor/` directory directly. Clone or sync this repo so `.cursor/skills/p2e-mode/` and `.cursor/rules/p2e-policy.mdc` are visible from your project root.

- Type **`/p2e-mode`** in Agent chat — Enter attaches it to one message; **Option+Enter** (Mac) / **Alt+Enter** (Windows) or **Use as Mode** keeps it on for the whole session as a Custom Mode (cyan `book-open` badge)
- The always-applied rule `.cursor/rules/p2e-policy.mdc` keeps Cursor aligned with Claude and Codex
- Point Cursor at the P2E MCP server via `.cursor/mcp.json` (or your global Cursor MCP config) using the same URL as [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json) — `https://p2e.columenlabs.com/api/mcp` by default

### Cloud Agents (product repos)

Do **not** put a skill path in `.env`. Hook the same `.cursor/environment.json` `install` / `start` scripts that already materialize `.env`:

```json
{
  "install": "git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/columenlabs/p2e-plugin.git \"$HOME/p2e-plugin\" && bash \"$HOME/p2e-plugin/scripts/install-p2e-cursor-skills.sh\"",
  "start": "bash \"$HOME/p2e-plugin/scripts/install-p2e-cursor-skills.sh\" --update",
  "repositoryDependencies": ["github.com/columenlabs/p2e-plugin"]
}
```

Append those commands to your existing `install` / `start` (keep your `.env` and dependency steps). `install` snapshots the clone into the Build; `start --update` pulls `main` at the beginning of each session so new Cloud Agents pick up plugin changes without a rebuild. The script symlinks **`p2e-mode`**, the always-apply rule, and merges MCP config into the product workspace. Symlinks are listed in `.git/info/exclude` so they are not committed.

Commit a `p2e` entry in the product repo's `.cursor/mcp.json` (same URL as [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json)) so MCP is present even before the script merges it.

## Bind a repo (`.p2e/project.json`)

Create `.p2e/project.json` at the repo root with your P2E product binding:

```json
{
  "slug": "your-product-slug",
  "github_repo": "owner/name"
}
```

Derive `github_repo` from `git remote get-url origin` and match `slug` against the P2E products you are a member of. Commit this file so all team members share the same binding.

Once the file is present, two plugin hooks activate automatically on Claude Code:

- **SessionStart** — injects a system-reminder at the start of every session naming the bound `project_slug` and `github_repo`.
- **PreToolUse** — intercepts every `mcp__plugin_p2e_p2e__*` tool call and blocks it if `project_slug` does not match the bound slug, printing a clear mismatch error with the bound value.

Neither hook does anything in repos that lack `.p2e/project.json` — non-P2E repos are unaffected.

## Configure

The plugin talks to a running P2E instance. It ships with the hosted primary production endpoint at `https://p2e.columenlabs.com/api/mcp` written as a concrete URL in [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json). (The Vercel host `p2e-mocha.vercel.app` is parallel/legacy — not the canonical MCP URL.)

To point it at your own instance, edit that URL directly — either in the plugin's `.mcp.json`, or in your own product repo's project-scoped `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "p2e": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://<your-p2e-instance>/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The shipped `.mcp.json` holds a **literal** URL on purpose: Codex does not expand shell-style `${VAR:-fallback}` syntax in its MCP auth flow, and an unexpanded `${...}` string breaks Codex login discovery. Keep the plugin's own `.mcp.json` literal so it stays Codex-safe.

Claude Code *does* expand that syntax at connect time. If Claude Code is your only host, you can drive the endpoint from the environment in **your own** project-scoped `.mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "p2e": { "type": "http", "url": "${P2E_MCP_URL:-https://p2e.columenlabs.com/api/mcp}" } } }
```

Cursor takes the same URL in `.cursor/mcp.json`, and Codex users editing an already-installed MCP entry should set a concrete URL.

Auth is handled by the host application's MCP flow on first use.

## MCP tool surface

The plugin exposes the P2E MCP server tools via `mcp__plugin_p2e_p2e__*`. Each tool accepts an `op` parameter to select the operation.

| Tool | Ops | Summary |
|------|-----|---------|
| `waves` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update` | First-class Wave packages (`W{n}`, unbounded). `get` returns freeze (members, gate, branch, status, shipChecks, PR). Prefer `waves.get` before BUILD story lists. Membership rewrite stamps `Story.wave`. |
| `stories` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `move` | Core story CRUD. `create` / `update` accept `wave` (`W{n}` unbounded, or `null`). Legacy `priority` aliases still accepted. `update` also accepts `github_pr_url`. `list` supports multi-value filters (see below). `get` returns full detail including audit log, capabilities, and acceptance criteria. `move` re-parents a story to another UXO. |
| `criteria` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `propose` | Acceptance criteria attached to a story. Agents use `op=propose` for verifier/reviewer assessments (see p2e-model MCP role mapping). |
| `capabilities` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete` | Story capabilities (INTRODUCES / MODIFIES / DEPRECATES change entries). |
| `relations` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `delete` | Inter-story relations (BUILDS_ON, DEPENDS_ON, SUPERSEDES, FIXES, etc.). |
| `products` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update` | Product management — UXO health summary, member roster, seeded Flows. **Canonical** as of Patton v3. |
| `projects` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update` | Deprecated alias for `products`, kept for one release. Prefer `products` in new calls. |
| `flows` | `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `reorder` | Flow CRUD. Every Product is seeded with a persona Flow and an immutable Foundation Flow. |
| `uxos` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete` | UXO (feature objective) CRUD. Flow membership (persona vs Foundation) is the meaningful structural axis. |
| `phases` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete` | Journey phases that contain UXOs. Foundation phase slots are seeded and immutable. |
| `features` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete` | Features that group UXOs across phases. |
| `tags` | `list` | Project-scoped tag registry derived from story tags. |
| `members` | `list`, `invite`, `remove`, `update` | Product membership management. |
| `coverage` | `get` | UXO coverage report: counts of DONE/partial/gap stories per UXO. |
| `story_assets` | `list`, `get`, `upload_url`, `link`, `create`, `delete` | File assets attached to a story. Preferred upload path for binary evidence: `op=upload_url` (signed-URL PUT to Vercel Blob). |
| `story_log` | `append` | Append a narrative log entry to a story. Append-only — no `update` or `delete`. |
| `evidence` | `validate_proof`, `template` | AC evidence proof contract validation and template generation. |
| `validate` | `run` | Run the P2E story-thickness predicate against a story and return failing clauses. |
| `create_github_issue` | — | Create a linked GitHub issue for a story (one-shot). |
| `sync_github_status` | — | Reconcile P2E story status with the linked GitHub issue label. |

> Note: only the `products`/`projects` tool changed its key parameter under Patton v3. Every other tool still takes `project_slug`. The `.p2e/project.json` binding anchors that one slug value.

### Multi-value `stories.list` example

Single-value filters (legacy, still work):

```json
{ "op": "list", "project_slug": "p2e", "status": "DONE", "release": "v0.9", "tag": "auth" }
```

Multi-value filters:

```json
{
  "op": "list",
  "project_slug": "p2e",
  "statuses": ["DONE", "IN_REVIEW"],
  "releases": ["v0.9", "v1.0", null],
  "tags": ["auth", "ui"],
  "tag_mode": "all"
}
```

- `statuses` — `StoryStatus[]`; matches stories whose status is in the array (IN semantics). Overrides single `status`.
- `releases` — `(string | null)[]`; matches stories whose release is in the array. A `null` entry matches stories with no release set. Overrides single `release`.
- `tags` + `tag_mode` — `tags` is a `string[]`; `tag_mode` is `"any"` (default, OR) or `"all"` (AND). Overrides single `tag`.

All three filters compose with AND semantics against each other and with other filters (`phase`, `uxo_id`, `feature_id`).

## Flow / Foundation model

P2E's Patton v3 ontology, which this plugin tracks:

- A project is a **Product** (`mcp__p2e__products`, `product_slug`). The legacy `mcp__p2e__projects` tool still works for one deprecation window.
- Every Product is seeded with exactly two **Flows** — a **persona Flow** (`type=persona`, the user-journey lane) and a **Foundation Flow** (`type=foundation`, name "Foundation"). The Foundation Flow and the earliest persona Flow are **system-immutable**.
- The Foundation Flow owns **8 fixed phase slots**: `Surfaces`, `Security`, `Data`, `Compute`, `Build-Deploy`, `Distribution`, `Observability`, `Cross-cutting`. Never create Foundation phases via MCP.
- The story graph is **Story → UXO → Phase → Flow → Product**. A story's Flow membership is derived by following `story.uxo.phase.flow`.
- The **tier** axis is deprecated. Flow membership (persona vs Foundation) is the meaningful structural axis.
- **Wave** is a first-class package owned by Product+Release with unbounded `n` (`W{n}` — no W25 ceiling). Call `waves.get` before BUILD membership lists. Layer `wave` stamps are denormalized; ordered membership lives on the Wave.
