# Cursor skills and rules reference

Distilled from Cursor docs. Refresh when upstream changes.

Cursor's surface is closer to Claude than Codex: it has both **skills** (`/`-invokable workflows, the modern equivalent of slash commands) and **rules** (always-on or context-attached guidance). It does not natively load Claude or Codex plugin manifests, so cross-platform compliance means shipping equivalent files in `.cursor/`.

## Layout

```
my-repo/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── skills/
│   │   └── <skill-name>/
│   │       └── SKILL.md
│   └── rules/
│       ├── <rule>.mdc
│       └── nested/<rule>.mdc
└── AGENTS.md           # optional, simplified always-on instructions
```

Cursor also reads from `~/.cursor/skills/` (global) and nested project paths like `apps/web/.cursor/skills/`.

## Skills (`.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)

Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: When and what this skill does.
paths:
  - "**/*.tsx"     # optional glob list — limits applicability
---
```

Invocation: type `/skill-name` in agent chat. Cursor migrated legacy slash commands to skills via `/migrate-to-skills`; new work should ship as skills, not commands.

## Rules (`.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`)

Frontmatter (three fields, all optional but they determine how the rule activates):

```yaml
---
description: Explain rule purpose for agent relevance detection
globs: src/**/*.tsx, docs/**/*.md
alwaysApply: false
---
```

| Type | `alwaysApply` | `description` | `globs` | Trigger |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| Always Apply | `true` | — | — | Every chat session |
| Apply Intelligently | `false` | provided | omitted | Agent decides from description |
| Apply to Specific Files | `false` | — | provided | File matches glob |
| Apply Manually | `false` | omitted | omitted | `@rule-name` mention |

Glob syntax: `*` (single segment), `**` (recursive), comma-separated for multiple patterns.

## AGENTS.md

Simplified always-on instructions in repo root or subdirectories. No frontmatter. Overlaps in role with `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` `alwaysApply: true`.

## Discovery

- Skills: `/<name>` in chat
- Always-apply rules: every session
- Auto-attached rules: when matching files are open
- Agent-requested rules: model selects based on `description`
- Manual rules: `@<rule-name>`

## Custom Modes (skill → session mode)

Any skill with valid frontmatter can back a [Custom Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/prompting.md#custom-modes): `/skill-name` + Enter attaches to one message; Option+Enter / Alt+Enter (or **Use as Mode**) keeps it in context for the whole session. Style the mode badge with optional `icon` and `color` frontmatter (`color`: `default` | `green` | `cyan` | `blue` | `purple` | `magenta` | `orange` | `yellow` | `red` | `brand`). Set `disable-model-invocation: true` so the skill only loads when explicitly invoked or used as a mode.

## What this repo uses (v0.12+)

- `.cursor/skills/p2e-mode/SKILL.md` — Cursor entry skill; Custom Mode–ready (`icon: book-open`, `color: cyan`, `disable-model-invocation: true`)
- `.cursor/skills/p2e-build/`, `.cursor/skills/p2e-review/` — wave-run skills (`disable-model-invocation: true`, required `<release> <wave>` arguments)
- `.cursor/agents/p2e-reviewer.md` — release reviewer subagent (blind integration review; MCP role mapping in p2e-model)
- `.cursor/rules/p2e-policy.mdc` — repo-wide policy rule (always-apply) summarizing scope and pointing at `p2e-mode`
- `scripts/install-p2e-cursor-skills.sh` — product-repo Cloud Agent helper: clone this plugin and symlink `p2e-mode` + policy rule into the workspace from `.cursor/environment.json` `install` / `start --update`
- `AGENTS.md` — minimal pointer file so non-Cursor IDEs that read `AGENTS.md` get the same orientation

## Cross-platform compliance note

Cursor cannot read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Since v0.12, behavior lives in the single **`p2e-mode`** skill mirrored across platforms. See `skills/p2e-mode/SKILL.md` and `.cursor/skills/p2e-mode/SKILL.md`.
